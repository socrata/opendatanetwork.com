## Development

The ODN is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
After cloning the repository and downloading node,
simply run `npm install` from within the project directory
to install all dependencies.

The ODN backend uses syntactic features of ES6 that are only available in
recent versions of Node, so it may fail to run with older versions.
Make sure that you use the Node version specified in `package.json` (currently `6.2.2`).
You can check your node version using `node --version`.

### Memcached

The ODN uses [memcached](https://memcached.org/)
to cache responses to the [ODN Backend](https://github.com/socrata/odn-backend)
as well as other external resources.
While a cache is not necessary for development, it is recommended
because it drastically improves site performance.

#### Installation with Homebrew

Memcached is available over [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
To install it, use `brew install memcached`.
There are many options for running `memcached`.
To see them all, use `brew info memcached`.

#### Flushing the Cache

Run `./flush-memcache.sh` to flush the development cache.

### Build

The build process is automated using `gulp` and configured with `gulpfile.js`.

To build the application, simply run `gulp`. This will automatically
build all javascript and css assets and package them for deployment.
It will automatically rebuild when changes are detected in the source.
Note that some syntax errors will require restarting the build process.

To run the webserver, use `gulp start`, and then open [locahost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
The webserver will restart when changes are detected in the source.

It can be useful to open two separate terminals: one to build the application,
and another to run the webserver.

### Testing

The ODN uses [casperjs](http://casperjs.org/) for functional testing.
To install `casperjs` globally, run `npm install -g casperjs`.
Tests are stored in the [/tests](/tests) directory
and can be run using `npm test`.

Sometimes, running tests will trigger a webserver restart which
will then cause many tests to fail.
If this happens, start the server using `node app.js`.

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests are run to check each deployment using
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/socrata/opendatanetwork.com).
These tests must pass for the deployment to succeed.

#### Running Tests before Committing

Since all tests must pass for a deployment to succeed,
it is a good idea to run unit tests locally before pushing to GitHub.
The `pre-commit.sh` script will make sure that all unit tests succeed before
every commit. To install it, run:

```sh
ln -s -f ../../scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Deployment

The ODN is hosted on Heroku.
There are two environments:
[production](https://opendatanetwork.herokuapp.com/) and
[staging](https://opendatanetwork-staging.herokuapp.com/).

To deploy to an environment, push to the corresponding branch on github.
For production, push to `master` and for staging, push to `staging`.
There should be no need to manually deploy to Heroku,
but if you do, make sure that `master` stays in sync with what is
on Heroku.

Note that `master` is a protected branch on Github.
To update the `master` branch, open a pull request, ensure that all tests
pass, and then have someone else review your changes.
Then, Github will allow merging the pull request into `master`
and Heroku will automatically deploy the application.

Check LastPass for Heroku access.

#### MemJS

The ODN uses the Heroku [MemJS](https://github.com/alevy/memjs) add-on
for memcached.
