##Deploying

Once you have compressed your CSS and JS, committed and pushed to Github, and you want to push your changes to Heroku, issue to the following command:

	$ git push heroku master

The sources will be pushed into your dyno and the site will be running the lastest bits.  The Heroku toolbelt and dashboard support rollbacks in case of a buggy build.
